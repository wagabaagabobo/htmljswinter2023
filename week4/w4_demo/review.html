        <h2><u>Reviews </u> </h2>
        <p> ''The best thing about American cinema is that besides the studio-assembled big ticket movies, there's also the flourishing indie film movement which keeps throwing up some delightfully refreshing movies.'' - Namrata Joshi</p>
        
        <p> ''First-time screenwriter Michael Arndt's script hits all the right notes, with a first-rate cast that makes this among the year's very best films.'' - Micheal Compton </p>

        <h2><u>Trivia</u> </h2>
        <ul>
            <li> Paul Dano was cast as Dwayne two years before production began. </li>
            <li> All of the girls acting as participants in the “Little Miss Sunshine” beauty pageant, except Abigail Breslin, were veterans of real beauty pageants. They wore the same costumes, including hair and makeup, and performed the same talent routines as they had in their real-life pageants.</li>
            <li> The production crew made sure Abigail Breslin really was listening to music in her headphones to keep her from hearing Alan Arkin’s profanity-laced scenes.</li>
            <li>The “heroin” Grandpa snorts in the bathroom in the beginning of the movie is actually crushed up Vitamin B tablets</li>
            <li>Though they are supposed to be mother and son, the difference of age between Toni Collette and Paul Dano is just 12 years.</li>
        </ul>
